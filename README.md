# ModsToYouWebsite
it's a website for the eventual Mods To You app. It will be written and rust in the easiest way for me to do possible because I am one person. It won't be pretty but it should be optimized & dark mode by default. Please do not bombard the server it's going to just be my laptop and it will only probably run on certain days for the first while. 

found a YouTube video that gave me a few libraries that should help making a website, not sure if I'll use every library, but I don't know what I'm doing so I'm just going to go with the first thing I found. The libraries include, Rocket, SurrealDB, Tauri (unsure if I'll use it), & YewI'm like 90% sure this is a very not optimal way of doing this so don't be like me do more research I'm just bored, lazy & I really really want to do this instead of spending 3 years researching.

I want competition to Nexus because I saw a YouTube video Tell me that they should have competition. (I have no money to back any of this up)
